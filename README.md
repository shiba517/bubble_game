## **Project Aim**
This is a project that I decided to create so I can practise my JS skills. It has pushed me to think a little more dynamically towards how I code. Though the coding is not complete and perfect, I will be continuing to improve upon it. I hope you will enjoy the game :)

## **Instructions**
Hit as many mushrooms as you can whislt avoiding the bees, rhinos, and ghosts. More mushrooms you hit, the more points. More bees, rhinos and ghosts you hit, the less points. 
- beed will only deduct points
- rhinos will deduct points and push you away
- ghosts will deduct points and take away a life (life minusing has not been implemented yet)

## **Planned changes to be made soon**
- Player will not run off screen when first opening page
- life system
- addition of bonus points via new characters
- sound effects
- animation of characters
- convert code to OOP format(!!!)
